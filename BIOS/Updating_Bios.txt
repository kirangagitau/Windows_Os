There are times when bios update is deemed as necessary and as such one need be very cautios
on how the do that. The safest source of the bios updates is the support site of the computer in question.
If HP, then HP drivers support site.
STEP 1:- Check the current version of bios in your machine, use the command
                wmic bios 

STEP 2:- Get serial number of your machine, use the command
                wmic bios get serialnumber

STEP 3:- GO to support site and view available bios diver updates for your machine by putting in 
        the serial number of your machine and doing search.

STEP 4:- Comparing version in your machine vs latest version from the site.

STEP 5:- Download all the bios whose version is above the current one in your machine and install them 
          sequentially  otherwise this would bring about conflict if you jump straight into intalling 
          the latest bios driver. Skipping two or more bios versions may cause 'conflict'.
