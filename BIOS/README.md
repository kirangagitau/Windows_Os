BIOS stands for Basic Input/Output System. It is a type of firmware that is built into the motherboard of a computer. 
The BIOS is responsible for initializing and testing the hardware components of the computer during the boot process. 
It provides a low-level interface between the operating system and the computer's hardware.

Here are some key functions of the BIOS:

- Power-On Self-Test (POST): When you turn on a computer, the BIOS performs a series of tests on the system's hardware components, such as the processor, memory, 
  storage devices, and input/output devices. If any issues are detected, the BIOS may display an error message or emit a series of beep codes to indicate the problem.

- Bootstrap Loader: After the POST is completed successfully, the BIOS locates the bootloader, which is a small program stored on the computer's storage device.
  The bootloader is responsible for loading the operating system into memory.

- BIOS Setup Utility: The BIOS provides a configuration interface called the BIOS Setup Utility. Users can access this utility during the
  boot process by pressing a specific key (often Del, F2, or another key) to enter the BIOS settings. In the BIOS Setup Utility, users can
  configure various settings related to hardware components, system clock, and other parameters.
